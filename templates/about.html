          Hey, Iâ€™m Dilshad ðŸ‘‹ â€” a computer science student who loves experimenting with code, breaking things (and fixing them again), and building projects that actually do something useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working with Python, APIs, and a bit of everything in between â€” from scraping data off the web to automating random ideas that pop into my head at 2 AM.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is basically my coding playground â€” a place where I document what I learn, share projects Iâ€™m proud of (and the ones that didnâ€™t go as planned), and hopefully help a few people along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably reading about new tech, tweaking my GitHub repos, or exploring how to make my next project cooler than the last one.
